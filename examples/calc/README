This is an example of the PEG DSL way of specifying Vimpeg grammars.

This directory (named calc/) is intended to sit under your pathogen bundle/
dir.

The autoload/ subdirectory contains two originally distributed files
(calculator.vim and calc.vimpeg) and a third, generated file, called calc.vim.
This generated file will be automatically created the first time you start Vim
after installing this example (as a plugin beneath your pathogen bundle/ dir,
for example).

The after/plugin/calculator.vim does two things:

1. It calls the corresponding autoload/calculator.vim library to ensure the
   calc.vim is generated from the calc.vimpeg file.

2. It provides the public interface function, Calc().

The test/ directory contains examples of how to call the Calc() function - it
is intended to be converted into a full-blown runVimTests() example.
